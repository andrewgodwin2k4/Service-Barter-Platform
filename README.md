# XERV – Service Barter Platform

XERV is a full-stack platform that enables users to **exchange services using credits instead of money**, encouraging collaboration, mutual support, and skill sharing.  
Users can browse a wide range of services, offer their own, request others, and manage barters through a structured, secure workflow.

This project demonstrates real-world implementation of **secure full-stack architecture**, including service matching logic, credit transactions, authentication, and dispute handling.
